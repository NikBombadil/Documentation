The Transporter is used to transport entities from one location to another. The default range of the transporter is 32 blocks. But with 4 Range Upgrade, it can increase up to 256 times, that is 8192 blocks in each direction.
The energy required to transport is based on the distance of the trip, and it doesnâ€™t matter how many entities there are in one trip.
