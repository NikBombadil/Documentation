The Gravitational Stabilizer is used to stabilize and lower the gravitational effect of Gravitational Anomaly. It must be pointed at the anomaly and have a clear sight to it. It can also show some useful information on the mass, range and brake strength of the Anomaly.
The stabilizer must have a clear line of sight to the anomaly. If the stabilizer is blocked for even a moment the anomaly will grow to itâ€™s original size. Glass and other transparent blocks can be safely placed in front of the stabilizer without blocking its sight.
Tritanium Glass is the best choice for placing near the anomaly.
