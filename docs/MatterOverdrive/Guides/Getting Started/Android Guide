Transformation

To become an Android, the first thing the player needs, is to find a full set of Android Parts. That means a Head, Arms, Legs and a Chest.

After that the player needs to find a Mad Scientist. He can only be found in Villages. He will ask the player for the set of Android Parts and will begin the process of Android Transformation.
After the Android Transformation the player WILL DIE.

When the Android Transformation is complete, the player will respawn, and will now be an Android.

That means that he can now use the Android Station to unlock Abilities.
