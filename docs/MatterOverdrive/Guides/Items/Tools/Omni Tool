The Omni tool is a powerful, long range mining tool, that also doubles as quite a handy pistol. Not as powerful as the Phaser Rifle. The Omni tool enables the player to mine blocks from quite a range by right clicking and holding the tool. The tool can also be upgraded with weapon modules at a Weapon Station.
